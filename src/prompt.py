## Context about SoCraTes value
Here's the "values" page from the SoCraTes website:
```
Inclusiveness
A goal of SoCraTes conference is to be inclusive and welcoming to attendees with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. See accessibility for the related details.

We loathe the war in Ukraine and strongly object to any form of violence and oppression against a civil population. However, we also want to be inclusive, and therefore we do not exclude people based on their country of origin. While we stand with the people of Ukraine, we will not accept harassment of Russian citizens solely based on their nationality.

Code of Conduct
Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before coming to the conference. But please don’t feel intimidated by it—these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at the conference.

Why we have a CoC
We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can only work if we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors, and if we create an environment, where everybody feels safe and welcome.

Yes, we value discussion and disagreement. And discussion can become heated. But there have to be rules, and there has to be a red line.

In this code of conduct, we lay out those rules and red lines.

Safe Environment
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

And so we invite all those who participate in SoCraTes, and the community surrounding the conference, to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, this conference can be a great experience for everyone!

Treat everyone professionally. Everybody at the conference is a professional in their field. Treat all attendees as equals. Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked. The person you are talking to right now might know more, or different things about the topic than you!
Be welcoming, friendly, and patient. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
Be respectful. Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
Whenever possible, use inclusive language: For example, say "folks" or "friends" instead of "guys", and be mindful that some people prefer different pronouns than those you would assume.
If you misspeak, don't feel bad - just apologize and do better next time.
Be careful with jokes. We do not tolerate any CoC violations, even if “it was just a joke”.
Admit when you do not know something. Encourage others to admit when they do not know something—and never joke about it. We are all here to learn.
CoC Violations
If you think someone has violated our code of conduct—even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard a conversation—please:

Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
Contact the organisers of SoCraTes (See contact details below).
But please give people the benefit of doubt. If there is even a slight chance that this was a misunderstanding (e.g. the person did not speak in their native language, and did not find the right words), try to sort it out in a friendly, constructive way.

When we learn about a CoC violations, organisers will hear both sides, and then take action we deem appropriate, such as:

Give a warning
Have a longer talk about our values
Expel the perpetrator from the conference without a refund (requires two organisers to agree, if this was the first offence)
Call the authorities
Unacceptable Behaviour
Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:

Harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. Deliberate intimidation and threats.
Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
Insulting or putting down other participants.
Publishing or telling others, that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
“Well-actuallies”: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Context about Inclusiveness at SoCraTes

Here's the "Inclusiveness" page from the SoCraTes website:
```
Discrimination & Sensitivity: Explanations
These explanations are not exhaustive or complete; they are merely intended to provide guidance on certain terms and topics that are important to us.

# Consent
Only ‘yes’ means ‘yes’!

'Maybe', ‘I don't know’, ‘not really’ and the like are not active consent. 'No' means no. Asking for or actively expressing consent can be very unfamiliar. We are often wrong when we unreflectingly or tacitly assume what someone (does not) want. Therefore: Consensus is the active agreement of all those involved.

# Self-designation
People are often referred to by categories or designations to which they do not feel they belong or which they themselves would describe differently (external designation). Self-designations, on the other hand, are names that a socially marginalized group chooses for itself. An example of this is BIPoC (see paragraph on BIPoC).

Which pronoun does a person want to be addressed with? If you are unsure about how a person or group would like to be addressed or referred to, it is a good idea to ask. An expression such as “The person is read by me as ...” leaves the actual affiliation to a group open.

# Discrimination
Discrimination in the legal sense is any unjustified unequal treatment based on “race”, ethnic origin, gender, religion, world view, disability, age or sexual orientation. Discrimination can occur consciously or unconsciously. It is linked to prejudices or stereotypical expectations of normality, for example. It can happen openly and directly (direct discrimination), for example when someone is not invited to a job interview because of their name, or is rejected when looking for accommodation because of their skin color.

Discrimination is a social phenomenon of placing at a disadvantage, segregation and devaluation. Groups or individuals are disadvantaged, devalued and oppressed on the basis of (supposed) characteristics, e.g. ethnic or social origin, religion or gender (so-called multidimensional discrimination).

# Privileges
Privileges are often referred to as social advantages that one has due to a supposed membership of a socially constructed group. Privileges open up opportunities and scope for action. People who are ascribed a social ‘normality’ (e.g. white, male, cisgender, able bodied, etc.) are considered privileged. Positions that deviate from this, i.e. the supposed ‘others’, are disadvantaged, i.e. discriminated against.

# Age discrimination, ageism, adultism
If children, young people or older people are treated unequally solely because of their age and without a valid reason, this is age discrimination. For example, if people of an older age are suddenly no longer taken seriously and their view of the world is no longer considered relevant, simply because of their age, this is a form of discrimination. Unfortunately, we find it rather “normal” in our society when children and young people are discriminated against.

Discrimination against children and young people is also known as adultism or epiphanism.

Discrimination against older people is often referred to as ageism (from age = old age).

# Ableism
“Ableism denotes the revaluation and devaluation of people according to the abilities attributed to them, which leads to discrimination against chronically ill and disabled people.

Ableism assumes a physical and psychological ideal standard of the human being, which chronically ill and/or disabled people cannot live up to. They are therefore considered ‘inferior’.

On a social level, it means that disabled and/or chronically ill people are often excluded and made invisible." (loosely translated from leidmedien.de/begriffe)

# Lookism
is discrimination on the basis of appearance and supposed ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ external characteristics, e.g. in relation to clothing, body shape and style. It is based on an assumed standardized ideal of beauty and the assumption that a person's value or skills are related to this.

# Fatphobia
Fatphobia is a form of prejudice based on body size, where negative assumptions and judgments are made about individuals based on their weight. It perpetuates the belief that thinner bodies are superior, healthier, or more attractive, often disregarding the diversity of natural body shapes and sizes.

Fatphobia refers to the irrational fear, discrimination, or aversion toward individuals who are perceived as overweight or obese. Rooted in societal biases, fatphobia manifests in prejudice, stereotypes, and systemic inequities that marginalise individuals based on their body size. This bias permeates various facets of life, including media representation, workplace dynamics, healthcare access, and personal relationships.

# Diversity
It means variety. People and bodies are diverse. In this context, this refers to diversity in terms of gender, sexual orientation, geographical, cultural, social origin, skin color, religion, age, etc.

# Classism
It refers to discrimination based on social origin and/or social and economic position. Classism is therefore not just about how much money someone has at their disposal, but also about their status and the financial and social circumstances in which they grew up.

Classism is mainly directed against people of a “lower class”. In particular, homeless and unemployed people and people from the working and poverty classes are marginalized.

# Social chauvinism
It means the discrimination of people on the basis of their social origin or ascribed social position in society. Social chauvinism mainly affects people who are unemployed and affected by poverty, homeless people, laborers or people with no or low educational qualifications.

# BIPoC
stands for Black, Indigenous, People/Person of Color and is a self-designation of people who experience racism because they are not perceived as white or of the citizenship of the country they are in.

# Racism
is the discrimination and devaluation of people on the basis of supposed origin, skin color, culture and religion. The word ‘racism’ is derived from the term ‘race’, which (although still used in the German Grundgesetz / constitution) is anthropologically indefensible. The division of people into alleged ‘races’ originated at the time of colonization. At that time, attempts were made to scientifically justify the exploitation and enslavement of people in Africa, South America and Asia with the alleged superiority of the ‘white race’.

The “racial theory” and the classification of people according to biological criteria have long been refuted by researchers and were entirely fictional. However, the ideas that emerged back then are still being spread and believed.

People continue to be differentiated according to physical characteristics such as skin color, eye, nose and mouth shapes, hair structure or characteristics that people wear on or around their bodies, such as a hijab, and condemned as ‘inferior’, ‘foreign’ or ‘abnormal’.

There are different forms of racism: anti-Asian racism, islamophobia, antiziganism, antisemitism, ethnopluralism, anti-black racism. A subtype is cultural racism, which is always present when habits, customs and traditions are seen as negative and inferior to one's own culture ( see also DaMigra, 2019, Speak Up Sister! ).

# » Islamophobia / Anti-Muslim racism
Discrimination occurs because people are seen as belonging to the religion - regardless of whether they are Muslim. The devaluation is based on the idea of Islam as a non-white and non-European religion, which is presented as incompatible with the “Western values” of the so-called “Christian-Jewish Occident”.

# » Antisemitism
It appears in different forms and has adapted to the respective contexts over the centuries. Anti-Semitism is not about the individual, but about the principle of ‘Jew’, which is associated with conspiracy theories and inhuman attributions. In contrast to other forms of discrimination, the supposed axis of power runs from the bottom up: A small powerful group is invented (constructed) to be responsible for the misfortunes of a large community. Antisemitism includes, for example, directly expressed hatred of Jews, conspiracy thinking, denial and relativization of the Shoah and others.

# » Everyday racism
We speak of everyday racism when we are not dealing with ideologically based and entrenched racism, but with racist incidents in the so-called ”middle of society“, which must be dealt with in the same way. These often happen in the form of (but are not limited to) microaggressions, like a white person “innocently” asking a person of different skin culture what country they are from.

# » Anti-Black racism
Racism against Black people is also referred to as colonial racism. The colonial states used anti-Black racism to justify the genocides, enslavement, rape, exploitation and oppression of people in the occupied territories: Not only was it falsely propagated that there were biological “human races”, but value judgments were also introduced: white people were seen as superior and of higher value, black people as inferior and inferior. It was spread that at the very least, white and black people were fundamentally different (othering). The consequences of this thinking still lead to anti-Black racism today.

# Patriarchy
This literally means “rule of the father”. The word is used to describe a society in which masculinity is valorized and femininity is devalued. It means that men shape, control and represent society.

# Sexism
This term refers to devaluation based on biological and/or chosen gender identity. Women and people not conforming to the male gender “norm” are affected. Sexism is a form of patriarchal oppression.

# Heteronormativity
This is the assumption that “all people are either cis-women or cis-men and that only men and women can find each other sexually attractive or fall in love with each other.” Heteronormativity is also the assumption that women and men have a certain ‘nature’, ‘behavior’, ‘taste’ and ‘preference’ and behave in a certain way. In other words, it is a socially produced ‘norm’ that only designates heterosexuality as the standard. All other lifestyles, such as homo*sexuality, are therefore seen as deviant or exceptional or special, in many cases they are seen as wrong.

# Homophobia
It describes the discrimination of queer people. It is based on ‘heteronormativity’, i.e. the (unconscious) expectation that all people are cisgender and heterosexual. Other gender identities and forms of desire are devalued, marginalized or made invisible. Sometimes written as homo*phobia, the * stands for people who do not fall into the categories of ‘man’ or ‘woman’.

# LGBTQIA+
It stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans*, Queer, Intersex, Asexual and others. The plus denoting that many others belong, and the term is inclusive.

# Intersex / intersex person
This refers to the congenital presence of genetic and/or anatomical and/or hormonal sexual characteristics that do not correspond to the gender norms of “man” and “woman”. In many places, heteronormativity is still so prevalent that corrective surgery is performed on intersex children, with some of them only learning later in life that they even are intersex. So in contrast to other mentioned groups who are exposed to discrimination, intersex people also experience a severe form of erasure.

# Cis, cisgender
Cis is a term referring to a person who identifies with the gender assigned to them at birth. The term can be problematic for intersex people because the juxtaposition in the usage of “cis” and “trans*” can render them invisible, or incorrectly assign them to “trans*”. It should therefore be used with caution.

# Trans*
Transgender is an umbrella term encompassing all gender-identities that lie outside of the cis “norm”. The asterisk was added to specifically denote that it is an inclusive term.

# Transphobia
It describes discrimination against people whose sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity, or those where the discriminating party incorrectly assumes such.
