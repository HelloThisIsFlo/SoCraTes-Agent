## Context about sessions at SoCraTes
This email was sent to all participants, it gives context on the kind of sessions you can expect at SoCraTes:

```
At SoCraTes, you'll find a rich diversity of topics, blending both technical and non-technical sessions in a dynamic push-and-pull format. There's truly something for everyone!

- **Push Sessions:** The host shares knowledge on a specific topic.
- **Pull Sessions:** The host asks for help or advice from participants.
- **Create Your Own Sessions:** Feel free to propose a session on anything you want to learn or share! Not sure what to bring to the agenda? Here are some ideas:
    - **Share your knowledge:** Learned a new technology? Talk about it!
    - **Learn something new:** Interested in a promising technology? Start a pull session and invite experts to join. This always works!
    - **Discuss important topics:** Think emotions at work are crucial? Others will too, and they'll be happy to discuss.
    - **Continue your routine:** Don't want to miss your daily yoga? Invite others to join you.
    - **Share your hobbies:** An absolute nail polish nerd? Bring your supplies and host a session!
```

## Context about SoCraTes value
Here's the "values" page from the SoCraTes website:
```
Inclusiveness
A goal of SoCraTes conference is to be inclusive and welcoming to attendees with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. See accessibility for the related details.

We loathe the war in Ukraine and strongly object to any form of violence and oppression against a civil population. However, we also want to be inclusive, and therefore we do not exclude people based on their country of origin. While we stand with the people of Ukraine, we will not accept harassment of Russian citizens solely based on their nationality.

Code of Conduct
Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before coming to the conference. But please don’t feel intimidated by it—these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at the conference.

Why we have a CoC
We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can only work if we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors, and if we create an environment, where everybody feels safe and welcome.

Yes, we value discussion and disagreement. And discussion can become heated. But there have to be rules, and there has to be a red line.

In this code of conduct, we lay out those rules and red lines.

Safe Environment
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

And so we invite all those who participate in SoCraTes, and the community surrounding the conference, to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, this conference can be a great experience for everyone!

Treat everyone professionally. Everybody at the conference is a professional in their field. Treat all attendees as equals. Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked. The person you are talking to right now might know more, or different things about the topic than you!
Be welcoming, friendly, and patient. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
Be respectful. Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
Whenever possible, use inclusive language: For example, say "folks" or "friends" instead of "guys", and be mindful that some people prefer different pronouns than those you would assume.
If you misspeak, don't feel bad - just apologize and do better next time.
Be careful with jokes. We do not tolerate any CoC violations, even if “it was just a joke”.
Admit when you do not know something. Encourage others to admit when they do not know something—and never joke about it. We are all here to learn.
CoC Violations
If you think someone has violated our code of conduct—even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard a conversation—please:

Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
Contact the organisers of SoCraTes (See contact details below).
But please give people the benefit of doubt. If there is even a slight chance that this was a misunderstanding (e.g. the person did not speak in their native language, and did not find the right words), try to sort it out in a friendly, constructive way.

When we learn about a CoC violations, organisers will hear both sides, and then take action we deem appropriate, such as:

Give a warning
Have a longer talk about our values
Expel the perpetrator from the conference without a refund (requires two organisers to agree, if this was the first offence)
Call the authorities
Unacceptable Behaviour
Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:

Harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. Deliberate intimidation and threats.
Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
Insulting or putting down other participants.
Publishing or telling others, that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
“Well-actuallies”: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
